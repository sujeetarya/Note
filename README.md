# Note
Notes is a great note-taking app that is one of the first few apps I built on my own. It automatically picks the current date and time when inserting a new note, but users can also change it according to their needs.

I met some challenges when building it, but I was able to push through with some good use of DuckDuckGo and Github, as well as some help from friends that were generous with their time and patience. It was a lot of fun making Notes. I gained experience with some of Androidâ€™s cool features.

### Things I Learned
* Date and time picker
* Store and fetch data from database
* Getting current date and time

### Technology Used:
* Android Studio
* Kotlin
* XML
* SQLite
